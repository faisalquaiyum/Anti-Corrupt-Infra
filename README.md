Anti-Corruption Infrastructure Management System

🚀 Overview

Anti-Corruption Infrastructure Management System is a MERN stack web application designed to prevent corruption in infrastructure
projects by ensuring direct and transparent fund allocation from the government to local representatives (e.g., ward councilors). 
The system integrates AI-based cost estimation, real-time monitoring, and blockchain transparency to prevent fund mismanagement.

📌 Features

✅ Government Fund Allocation System in phases
✅ AI-Based Project Cost Estimation
✅ Real-Time Progress Updates with Images
✅ Voting System for Reporting Issues
✅ Blockchain for Transparent Transactions
✅ Role-Based Access for Users

🏗️ Project Architecture
The system consists of:

Frontend (React.js + Vite): User dashboard, project tracking.
Backend (Node.js + Express.js): APIs for data processing.
Database (MongoDB): Storing user data, projects, and transactions.
AI Module (Python/ML Model): Estimates project costs based on images.
Blockchain - Smart Contracts): Secures fund allocation.

🌍 User Roles & Workflow

1️⃣ Government Officials
Allocate funds for infrastructure projects.
Approve project proposals after AI-based verification.

2️⃣ Ward Councilors / Representatives
Upload issues with images.
Get AI-based cost estimation.
Receive funds upon approval.

3️⃣ Citizens
Report issues in their locality.
Vote for the most critical problems.
Track project status.
